#1 Observational Data are measurements collected from observation, errors, biases and limitations. Reality (Truth) is independent of measurement or perception.

#2 Aesthetics in Data Visualization are visual properties used to represent data like color, size, shape, line type & transparency
#3 The purple to green one is more suitable because color-blind persons can see it better.

#4 a. Identify distinct objects or groupings that lack inherent order, such as various nations on a map or additional producers of a particular good.
b. represent data values as (income temperature speed).
c. visualize the deviation of data values in a neutral midpoint.
d. specify elements in the data.

#5 a. Valid. breathing inherently involves inhaling and exhaling.
b. Valid. breathing and inhaling and exhaling are interchangeable.
c. invalid. consciousness, and breathing would not be logical. we can breathe without being conscious.
d. Invalid. consciousness is not equivalent to breathing. Because it requires brain activity not just breathing.
e. invalid. rain implies clouds, but clouds do not always imply rain.
f. invalid. rain does not guarantee the same conditions as cloudiness.
#6 Experiment,Theory & Computation
#7 No, Logical Implication: Physical Causation: 

#8 a) No, because it's linear without the usage of the blue data.
b) historical reconstructions from indirect evidence introduce high uncertainty because there are no direct temperature readings.
c) Yes, because it represents temperature anomalies documented across time with each data corresponding to a certain year.
d. The rise is because of increased industrial activity during & after World War II. Industrial activity after the war is to blame for the reduction.

#9 No, Representing probabilities with integer numbers would lose precision, as fractional values are not permitted by integers.

#10 Degrees of plausibility are represented by real numbers. Qualitative correspondence with Consistency and sense.

#11 a. 1-10 b. 1-10 c. 2-10

#12 No, Computers use floating-point numbers which can approximate real numbers but cannot represent all of them due to limited memory.

#13

#14 Git is a program that can be downloaded while GitHub is a web platform that's built on Git and making it easier to collaborate with others.

#15 Bayesian School of Probability allows the incorporation of expert knowledge through the use of prior probabilities.

#16 Bayesian school is most useful when data is scarce because it permits drawing conclusions despite the paucity of evidence by using past knowledge or assumptions.

#17 Frequentist school cannot define or discuss the probability of the existence of God because interpreting probability—which necessitates several experiments—as the long-term relative frequency of an event. The Frequentist framework is unable to make a meaningful likelihood of God's existence because it is not a recurring or observable phenomena.

#18 Because the data isn't separated into distinct age groups, it all kind of blurs together, making the graph difficult to read.

#19 Integers represents for binary data types.
#20 B
#21 Fortran

#23 on paper
#24 Deductive Reasoning: Derives specific conclusions from general premises.  Inductive Reasoning: Derives general conclusions from specific observations.

#25 truth tables are identical for all possible combinations of input variables.


#32 fundamental uncertainties in nature are epistemic uncertainty caused by a lack of knowledge and aleatory uncertainty, which results from innate unpredictability in processes like quantum mechanics, and reducible with improved knowledge.
