This can be read as pi, A given B. Here, 'Ï€' is pi, and '|' is given.

Name four major historical definitions of Probability.
The four types of probability. classical probability,Bayesian probability, frequentist probability PRopensity probability.
3
Which school(s) of thought define probability as the degree of belief?
Classical probability.
4
Which school(s) of thought define probability as the relative frequency of occurrence?
frequentist probabilty
5
Which probability definition(s), among those we have discussed in class, allow defining the Probability of the existence of God? Why?
Classical/ Bayesian probability.
6
Is Bayesian Inference a subset of the Frequentist Inference methods? Why?
No, Bayesian Inference is not a subset of frequentist methods. Bayesian traets parameters as random.
#7
Which inference methodology allows the inclusion of expert knowledge in data analysis and decision-making? Bayesian inference
#8
Why is Bayesian Probability Theory more popular among physicists and engineers and Frequentist Probability Theory more popular among Biologists and Social Scientists? The methods experiments are one-off or irreproducible and they align with many problems in physics and engineering.
#9
When did the first modern definition of Probability appear in history? 1700th .
10
What kinds of uncertainty exist in our experiments? confidence Strips,eyes, half-eyes, Quantile Dot plot.

#12 position, size, shape, color, line size.
#13 Continuous and discrete
#14 Factors are variables that represent categorical data. Levels are categories or distinct values within a factor.
#15 Continuous: size, color, width, area. discrete: size, color, width, area, shape, color, style.
#16 Factors.
#17 (ordered:) Quantitative, Numerical. unordered: Qualitative, categorical.
#18. Sequential color scales are best for ordered data like temperature, diverging scales highlight deviations from a midpoint like profit, categorical scales distinguish discrete groups like political parties and cyclic scales represent periodic data like time of day.
#19 3D perspective makes the plot difficult to read.
#20 Exam scores represent numerical for actual scores or categorical for grade bins (A, B, C).
#21 It can be both
#22. All three are valid but the red one is the best one because it's the easiest to understand.
#23. The purple and green ones are more accessible for color-blind people.

a. Qualitative color scale b. sequential color scale c. Diverging color scale d. accent color scale

Polar coordinates can be useful for data of a periodic nature, such that data values at one end of the scale can be logically joined to data values at the other end.

Accent color scale.

The graph is not well labelled and theres no header.

a. Increase. b. 5 degrees hotter.
