Express the mathematical meaning of Ï€(A|B)
Name four major historical definitions of Probability.
Which school(s) of thought define probability as the degree of belief?
Which school(s) of thought define probability as the relative frequency of occurrence?
Which probability definition(s), among those we have discussed in class, allow defining the Probability of the existence of God? Why?
Is Bayesian Inference a subset of the Frequentist Inference methods? Why?
Which inference methodology allows the inclusion of expert knowledge in data analysis and decision-making?
Why is Bayesian Probability Theory more popular among physicists and engineers and Frequentist Probability Theory more popular among Biologists and Social Scientists?
When did the first modern definition of Probability appear in history?
What kinds of uncertainty exist in our experiments? confidence Strips,eyes, half-eyes, Quantile Dot plot.

Suppose there is a donkey outside the classroom. I ask you what you observe and tell me what you see. You tell me that you see a horse. What kind of uncertainty is involved in your observation?

what are aesthetics in data visualization? Name a few aesthetics that can appear in a data visualization.

*Name the two major classes of aesthetics. Continuous and Discrete.

*What is the difference between factors and levels? Variables holding qualitative data are factors,and the different categories are called levels

*Name the two major types of data and provide an example for each category.

*What is the common name for variables holding data?

*Provide examples of ordered and unordered data.

*Name four different color scales and explain their most appropriate usage. 
1-Qualitative color scale: a means to distinguish discrete items or groups that do not have an intrinsic order,such as different countries on a map or different manufacturers of a certain product.
2-sequential color scale. Such a scale contains a sequence of colors that clearly indicate which values are larger or smaller than which other ones and (ii) how distant two specific values are from each other.
3- Diverging color scale to visualize the deviation of data values in one of two directions relative to a neutral midpoint.
4-

Professional Data Scientists tend to avoid 3D plots in their visualizations. Why?

Recall our class discussions on the kinds of data, for example, numerical vs. categorical.
Describe an example dataset that could be classified as either numerical or categorical, depending on how it is represented.

Is color a categorical/unordered or quantitative/ordered aesthetics?

The combination of a set of position scales and their relative geometric arrangement is called a coordinate system.
Coordinate systems allow us to assign unique IDs (a set of numbers called coordinates) to unique location on a map (think of Google map pins, for example).
When we deal with data, these unique IDs are often assumed to be data values that we want to visualize and each coordinate axis corresponds to a single data attribute.
Given this information, which one of the following three coordinates are valid and can be used to represent data or visualize the data attribute values?
(Hint: Recall that the sole criterion for the validity of coordinates is the ability to assign unique set of numbers (data values) to unique points in the coordinates space (visualization space).)
