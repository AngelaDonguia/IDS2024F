Express the mathematical meaning of π(A|B) -"The probability of ( A ) given ( B )." The meaning of Pi is that it represents probability in a specific notation.The meaning of | is that it indicates "given that," denoting conditional probability.
#2)Name four major historical definitions of Probability.- Classical Probability, Bayesian Probability, Frequentist Probability and Propensity.
#3 Which school(s) of thought define probability as the degree of belief? 1. Classical and Bayesian Probability.
#4
Which school(s) of thought define probability as the relative frequency of occurrence? Frequentist Probability and Propensity.
#5
Which probability definition(s), among those we have discussed in class, allow defining the Probability of the existence of God? Why?-Bayesian definition allows it to be based on degrees of belief or prior knowledge. It doesn't require empirical frequency or repeatable experiments.
#6
Is Bayesian Inference a subset of the Frequentist Inference methods? Why? No, Bayesian incorporates prior beliefs and updating probabilities with proof,Frequentist methods rely solely on observed data.
#7
Which inference methodology allows the inclusion of expert knowledge in data analysis and decision-making? Bayesian inference
#8
Why is Bayesian Probability Theory more popular among physicists and engineers and Frequentist Probability Theory more popular among Biologists and Social Scientists? The methods experiments are one-off or irreproducible and they align with many problems in physics and engineering.
#9
When did the first modern definition of Probability appear in history? Mid-20th century.
10
What kinds of uncertainty exist in our experiments? confidence Strips,eyes, half-eyes, Quantile Dot plot.

#12 position, size, shape, color, line size.
#13 Continuous and discrete
#14 Factors are variables that represent categorical data. Levels are categories or distinct values within a factor.
#15 Continuous: size, color, width, area. discrete: size, color, width, area, shape, color, style.
#16 Factors.
#17 (ordered:) Quantitative, Numerical. unordered: Qualitative, categorical.
#18. Sequential color scales are best for ordered data like temperature, diverging scales highlight deviations from a midpoint like profit, categorical scales distinguish discrete groups like political parties and cyclic scales represent periodic data like time of day.
#19 3D perspective makes the plot difficult to read.
#20 Exam scores represent numerical for actual scores or categorical for grade bins (A, B, C).
#21 It can be both
#22. All three are valid but the red one is the best one because it's the easiest to understand.
#23. The purple and green ones are more accessible for color-blind people.
#24. a. San Diego b. Chicago c. Death Valley d. Chicago
25. 1-Color to distinguish categories. 2-Color to represent data values (sequential) 3Color to represent data values (diverging) 4-Color as a tool to highlight
#26 Polar They  are best for visualizing periodic or cyclic data, like time-based patterns, directional data, or any dataset with a natural circular relationship between variables.
#27 Color as a tool to highlight.
#28 across the x-axis are diagonal and the bars are too close making it feel too crammed.
