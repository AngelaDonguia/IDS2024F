1.My estimate of the temperature anomaly in 2050 is 1.523âˆ˜C. The quadratic model forecasts a temperature increase by that year. My precise would be 1.522627537030428. Because of its exponential expansion, the data's rising tendency provides a more accurate depiction of reality.

2. Epsilon and MinPts are the two free parameters.
3.  The parameter that was instructed was not unique. example of a unique parameter,First we choose two parameters, a positive number epsilon and a natural number minPoints. We then begin by picking an arbitrary point in our dataset. If there are more than minPoints points within a distance of epsilon from that point, (including the original point itself), we consider all of them to be part of a "cluster" the ability to further increase the high epsilon while also low Minpts.

7.  by reducing the size of  modest epsilon it was more difficult to form a cluster.
     In order to reduce the number of points that qualified for the dense zone, I then raised MinPts to roughly The outcome is made to be an outlier.
