position, size, shape, color, line size.

Continuous and discrete.

Continuous: size, color, width, area. discrete: size, color, width, area, shape, color, style.

categorical variables.

ordered: Quantitative, Numerical(Day) unordered:Qualitative,categorical(location)
Discrete( station ID)
Numerical( temperature)

The common name for variables holding data is called factors. 

Geometric/Spatial Plots

Plotting economic data,Scientific data with large dynamic ranges.

The black or the red graph is ideal for plotting/represent data.

Heatcolor scale would be used for showing temperature on a map. 

-qualitative color scale- a means to distinguish discrete items or groups that do not have an intrinsic order.
-Sequential color scale- used to represent data values, such as income, temperature, or speed.
-Diverging color scale- the deviation of data values in one of two directions relative to a neutral midpoint.
-Accent color scales- to highlight specific elements in the data.

What is wrong with the following visualization?- the graph lacks proper labelling and context. which makes it difficult to interpret.

purple-green colors since many people are colorblind so its more accessible and easier to understand.

Classical Probability, Bayesian Probability, Frequentist Probability, Propensity.
