2. Three fundamental desiderata of probability theory are:
Non-Negativity,Normalization,Additivity

All data visualizations map data values into quantifiable features of the resulting graphic. We refer to these features as aesthetics. Few operations That can appear in data visualization are: color, shape, size, line width, line type.

All aesthetics fall into one of two groups -Those that can represent continuous data and those that can't

Continuous and discrete

-There are two types of data- continuous and discrete. 
qualitative(categorical)- color of a shirt
quantitaive data(numerical)- hieght of a person

The common name for variables holding data is called factors.

Ordered-education level Unordered- countries and colors

Qulaitative&Categorical(Month)
Ordered( Day)
Qualitative( location)
Discrete( station ID)
Numerical( temperature)

Coordinate system axes

Plotting economic data,Scientific data with large dynamic ranges.

The black colored grid is the most valid graph to show/ represent data.

Heat color scale would be good for showing temperature on a map. 

-qualitative color scale- a means to distinguish discrete items or groups that do not have an intrinsic order, such as different countries on a map or different manufacturers of a certain product.
-Sequential color scale- used to represent data values, such as income, temperature, or speed.
-Diverging color scale- the deviation of data values in one of two directions relative to a neutral midpoint.
-Accent color scales- an effective tool to highlight specific elements in the data.

What is wrong with the following visualization?
There is data before 0 and The visualization lacks proper labelling and context. which makes it difficult to interpret the given visualization.

Consider the following color palettes. Which one is more appropriate for effective visualization communications with humans?
The 2nd one is better because humans associate red is bad and with green is green is good, 5%-8% of humans are color blind.

Name four major schools of Probability Theory. Classical probability, Bayesian probability, frequentist probability, propensity probability
